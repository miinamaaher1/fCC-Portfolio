# fCC-Portfolio
This project is a practice portfolio showcasing basic responsive web design principles. It was created as part of the [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/), which I found incredibly helpful. And highly recommend it!
