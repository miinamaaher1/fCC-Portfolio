# fCC-Portfolio
This project is a practice portfolio showcasing basic responsive web design principles and basic DOM manipulation with JS. It was created as part of the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) and [freeCodeCamp JavaScript DOM Manipulation course](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys?si=dUB4D8gH6MPt0mxM), which I found incredibly helpful. And highly recommend it!
