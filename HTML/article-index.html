          <br>— Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic Battle</p>
          <p>Shadow the Hedgehog (シャドウ・ザ・ヘッジホッグ Shadō za Hejjihoggu?) is a character that appears in the <a href="https://www.sonicthehedgehog.com/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> series. He is an anthropomorphic hedgehog/Black Arms hybrid who resembles Sonic the Hedgehog in many ways[8] and serves as his arch-rival and occasional ally. Shadow was created as the "Ultimate Life Form" (究極生命体 Kyūkyoku Seimeitai?) by Gerald Robotnik by using the DNA of Black Doom and is the final result of Project Shadow. His purpose was to provide ways to develop a cure for incurable deadly illnesses, more specifically for Gerald's granddaughter Maria Robotnik, who he had a great bond with. However, he was eventually captured following his creation and put into stasis by G.U.N. when he was deemed as a threat to humanity.</p>
        <p>Fifty years later, Shadow was released by Dr. Eggman in order to assist him in his plan to conquer the earth. Initially, Shadow worked with him but secretly sought to destroy the planet in order to avenge Maria, who had been killed by the military, but was persuaded to save it from Gerald's doomsday plans. In the process, Shadow lost his memories and as such, sought to uncover the truth of his past, during which he met Black Doom and the Black Arms; in the end, Shadow regained his memories, uncovered the truth, and thwarted Black Doom's agenda and saved the world. From there, he continued his mission to protect humanity for the sake of Maria.</p>
        <p>Shadow is sharp-witted, always on edge, and has a strong sense of purpose, always willing to accomplish his goals by any means,[9] and always serious. Essentially a dark version of Sonic, Shadow can match him in both speed and skill, and can use Chaos Control with a Chaos Emerald to warp time and space.[10][8] While preferring to work alone and not one of his closest friends, he has helped Sonic and his allies when needed.</p></div>
